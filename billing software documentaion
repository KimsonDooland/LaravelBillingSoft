==================CHANGE THE PRODUCT QTY AND PUT IT ONLY IN INVENTORY QTY==================
==================HAVE THE BARCODE NUMBER IN THE PRODUCT TABLE =====================


Logic:

STEP 1.
1. Product comes in and gets stored in products table.
2. Generate random barcode number and link it with that product_id in the barcode table.
3. Print the Barcode's



STEP A under 1.

1. Save the product_id and product_qty.
2. when a invoice bill is generated the product_qty for that product_id will be minimized.


STEP 2.
1. Generate an invoice bill into pdf file.


WHAT IF SAME PRODUCT COMES BACK AGAIN IN A DIFFRENT QTY?
1. When ever the products are been added we will give them a button saying exesting product. 
2. If exestint product is true enter the barcode number, product_qty to generate.
3. update the newly entered product_qty_value to inventory table for that product_id.


EXTRAS

1. Check if barcode is unique. If not unique print again till unique.
2. Middle Ware


*******************************************************************************

FOR PRODUCT QTY WE assign the qty to the invertory table with the product id	

ADD NEW EXESTING PRODUCT
------------------------
1. put in the product code or id and submit-> we get the product or you just edit it from inventory.
